# Pokedex

Within this repository, I have developed a Pokedex application page utilising JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS. 

This page showcases all 150 first-generation Pok√©mon, meticulously organized by their unique ID numbers, and it even presents all three stages of their evolutions. Below, you'll find an image that represents the final output achieved through the code.

Update: The bastion bot that was used to generate the Pokemon pictures used in this project has been vandalised by cyber attackers. Therefore, images no longer render on the cards
